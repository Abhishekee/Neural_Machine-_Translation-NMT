# Neural_Machine-_Translation-NMT

This repositry contains the Sequence2Sequence Machine translation model using Natural Language processing. Encoder-Decoder network is deployed for the translation o English to Spanish langugae. Global Vector for Word Representation(GloVe) is used for English word embedding and custom embedding size layer has been used for the Spanish Translation.Long Short Term memory (LSTM) Network is used as the neural network architechture for passing the embedded words in the encoder model and also for the decoder model.This encoder-decoder model performed good on eng-spa translation dataset and reached the accuracy of 92% and validation accuracy of 90% on the testing set.
