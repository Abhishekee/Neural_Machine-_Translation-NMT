# Neural_Machine-_Translation-NMT

This repositry contains the Sequence2Sequence Machine translation model using Natural Language processing. Encoder-Decoder network is deployed for the translation o English to Spanish langugae. GloVe Embedding layer has been used for English word embeddings and custom embedding size layer has been used for the Spaish Translation.
Long Short Term memory (LSTM) Network is used as the neural network architechture for passing the embedded words in the encoder model and also for the decoder model.
This encoder-decoder model performed good on eng-spa translation dataset and reached the accuracy of 92% and validation accuracy of 90% on the testing set.
